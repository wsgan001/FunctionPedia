QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>I'd like to know if it is possible to have this application (<a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2010/04/neo4j-rest-server-part1-get-it-going.html" rel="nofollow">neo4j</a>) running on windows server 2008 alongside an asp.net mvc application. Reason for this, I need to access the graph database (neo4j) which provides a RESTful service from my mvc application. How would I go about setting up this architecture?</p>&#xA;

ACCEPTED ANS:
HTML:
<p>According to the website you linked to the application is self-contained (no Tomcat etc required). So just installing the Windows package and following the instructions here (<a href="http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Getting_Started_REST#For_Windows" rel="nofollow">for starting the service</a>) should suffice.</p>&#xA;
Comment:
He may need to change the default port number of `neo4j` to avoid colliding with (I guess) IIS.  But that should not be difficult.
Instructions for how to change the port are found at http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Getting_Started_REST#Configure_port
