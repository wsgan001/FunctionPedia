<p>According to this post on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120180/how-to-do-query-auto-completionsuggestions-in-lucene">how to do query auto-completionsuggestions in lucene</a> getting "Did You Mean" functionality best involves using a LuceneDictionary. But I probably would have used a fuzzy query for this before reading this post. Now I'm wondering which is faster, which is easier to implement?</p>&#xA;

While not about Lucene, nor an answer, that page is a good read, and makes Python look awesome.

<p>Have you looked at some NGram wrappers for Lucene. They are the best ways to do the "did you mean" functionality in Lucene. I <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2%5F2%5F0/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/ngram/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">found this page</a> for the docs. </p>&#xA;
