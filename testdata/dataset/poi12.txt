QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>Is there a way to Display a HSSFWorkbook Object in a JSP page without having an output file in the server side?&#xA;In the code below I am providing the template file and the beans required for <strong>net.sf.jxls.transformer.XLSTransformer.transformXLS(InputStream is, Map beanParams)</strong> to return me a HSSFWorkbook object. I now need a way to use this object in a JSP without having to store the output file in the server side using OutputStream.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(templateFileName));&#xA;HSSFWorkbook hm = transformer.transformXLS(is, beans);&#xA;req.getSession().setAttribute("excelWorkBook",hm);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
Comment:
display it how - output an Excel file, or display it as HTML within the page?
Yes Matt, i must show it as an Excel file but I must not store the Excel file any where in the server side,I must directly deliver it to the client.

ACCEPTED ANS:
HTML:
<p>Looks simple, write the HSSFWorkbook using the write method on your instance;</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>HSSFWorkbook#write(OutputStream)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>where the output stream is the;</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>response.getOutputStream()&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Youll probably want to do things like set the ContentType of the reponse as well as maybe some content dispostion attributes.</p>&#xA;

Hi Simon622, I used this step before but it threw me errors. My point is that I am exporting my HSSFWorkbook Object to the JSP page and I need to show the output of that object as an Excel spreadsheet without storing the resultant Excel file after HSSFWorkbook#write(OutputStream)&#xA;it at the server side.
Youll need to paste the error you are receiving when attempting to write the spreadsheet to the response, if we're to be able to help you further.
