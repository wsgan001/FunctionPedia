<p>I think you have to go down each HSSFRow and call HSSFRow.getCell and then HSSFRow.removeCell.  The API is oriented towards rows, rather than columns, and very few operations work at the whole column level.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sample code (untested):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>HSSFSheet sheet = ...&#xA;int colToRemove = 5;&#xA;Iterator rowIter = sheet.iterator();&#xA;while (rowIter.hasNext()) {&#xA;   HSSFRow row = (HSSFRow)rowIter.next();&#xA;   HSSFCell cell = row.getCell(colToRemove);&#xA;   row.removeCell(cell);&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

nope. doesn't work - this just removed all data of this cell (like content, style, ...) but the column is still there.
You would then need to shift all relevant cells one column to the left.
