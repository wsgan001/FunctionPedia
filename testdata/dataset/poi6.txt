<p>I would at least try to narrow this down, since that test does a number of things.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Can you open the original file in Word 2003 ?</li>&#xA;<li>can you open the file and immediately resave as another without doing any replacements.

Comment:
I can only replace text which has an equal length to the placeholder. Means ${xy} can be replaced with 12345 and not with 1234 or 123456
Can you open the original file in Word 2003 ? << yes &#xA;can you open the file and immediately resave as another without doing any replacements. Does that open in Word 2003 ? << i can open the original file. The replace result can't be opened.&#xA;&#xA;I use the .doc file from the JUnit test case: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/testcases/org/apache/poi/hwpf/data/testRangeReplacement.doc?view=co&#xA;&#xA;Like I said, the test went fine but the result can't be opened if i save it to a new .doc file.
