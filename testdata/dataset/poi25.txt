<p>If you just want to do this, and you don't care about the coding, you can just use <a href="http://www.winfield.demon.nl/" rel="nofollow">Antiword</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>$ antiword file.doc > out.txt</p>&#xA;

<p>I know this long after the fact but I've found TextMining on google code, more accurate and very easy to use. It is however, pretty much abandoned code.</p>&#xA;

<p><a href="http://tika.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Apache Tika</a> will do this for you. It handles talking to POI to do the HWPF stuff, and presents you with either XHTML or Plain Text for the contents of the file. If you register a recursing parser, then you'll also get all the embedded images too.</p>&#xA;
