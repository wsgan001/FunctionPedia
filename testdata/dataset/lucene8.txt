QUESTION:

<p>If anyone has done this, please let me know. I don't know anything about lucene.net. I have never used it, but I heard about it. I was wondering how something like that would integrate with the Linq entity framework?</p>&#xA;
Comment:
so.. any update on this? I'm about to dive in head first, so if you have any remarks, please make them public :)
Sorry, I never ended up using it for the project I was working on.
