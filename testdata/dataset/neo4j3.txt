QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>Both <a href="http://github.com/twitter/flockdb">FlockDB</a> and <a href="http://neo4j.org/">neo4j</a> are open source frameworks for keeping large graph dataset. Anyone familiar enough with both products to write a comparison?</p>&#xA;
Comment:
Very interesting, haven't seen FlockDB before. Looks like FlockDB has only very recently (last few days) been open-sourced by Twitter. Brings up the question of stability, since Neo4j has been around for a good while?

<p>For starters, here is what the FlockDB readme says:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>FlockDB is much simpler than other graph databases such as neo4j because it tries to solve fewer problems. It scales horizontally and is designed for on-line, low-latency, high throughput environments such as web-sites.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As one example, FlockDB isn't capable of doing deep graph traversal because it's designed to handle Twitter's single-depth followers/following model.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The video here has a pretty good summary from the CEO of Neo Technology where he briefly mentions FlockDB:  <a href="http://www.nosqldatabases.com/main/2010/7/5/need-a-graph-database-look-no-farther-than-neo4j.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosqldatabases.com/main/2010/7/5/need-a-graph-database-look-no-farther-than-neo4j.html</a></p>&#xA;
