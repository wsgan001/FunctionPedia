<p>What is the best full text search alternative to ms sql?  (which works with ms sql)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm looking for something similar to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow">Lucene</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/" rel="nofollow">Lucene.NET</a> but without the .NET and Java requirements. I would also like to find a solution that is usable in commercial applications.</p>&#xA;
Comment:
I prefer [Xapian](http://xapian.org/) - pure C++ Search Engine Library.
One note of caution on [Lucene.NET](http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/): it tends to lag behind Apache's [Java Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/) (the "official" Lucene). Lucene.NET is a port of Java Lucene, and the community around Java Lucene is larger. For obvious reasons, this can sometimes be a problem.

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://clucene.wiki.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CLucene</a> - It's a well maintained C++ port of java Lucene. It's currently licenced under LGPL and we use it in our commercial application.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Performance is incredible, however you do have to get your head around some of the strange API conventions.</p>&#xA;

<p><a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com" rel="nofollow">Sphinx</a> is one of the best solutions. It's written in C++ and has amazing performance.</p>&#xA;
Comment:
but it's not for ms sql
Lucene is not for MSSQL either, you can 2 choices: index documents prior passing it to DB or let indexing engine go through DB itself. Sphinx can't crawl MSSQL automatically as far as I know, but it has best indexing performance.

<p>I second Sphinx, but <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Lucene</a> is also not so bad despite the Java. :) If you are not dealing with too much data spread out etc., then also look into MySQL's <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html" rel="nofollow">FULLTEXT</a>. We are using it to search across a 20 GB database.</p>&#xA;

<p><a href="http://www.dtsearch.com/" rel="nofollow">DT Search</a> is hands down the best search tool I have used.  They have a number of solutions available.  Their Engine will run on Native Win32, Linux or .NET.  It will index pretty much every kind of document you might have (Excel, PDF, Word, etc.)  I did some benchmarks comparisons a while ago and it was the easiest to use and had the best performance.  </p>&#xA;
