QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>I've just learned POI and find the HSSF is very simple to read and create excel file (.xls).&#xA;However, I found some problem when want to read excel protected with password. &#xA;It took me an hour to find this solution on internet.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please could you help me to solve this problem. &#xA;I'm very glad if you could give me a code snippet.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you.</p>&#xA;
Comment:
Did you find or did you not find a solution for this problem? If you did, it would be nice to put it here.

ACCEPTED ANS:
HTML:
<p>POI will not be able to read encrypted <em>workbooks</em> - that means that if you have protected the <strong>entire</strong> workbook (and not just a sheet), then it won't be able to read it. Otherwise, it should work.</p>&#xA;

Thank Ravi Wallau :)

<p>Ravi is right. It seems you can read password protected, but not encrypted files with POI. See <a href="http://osdir.com/ml/user-poi.apache.org/2010-05/msg00118.html" rel="nofollow">http://osdir.com/ml/user-poi.apache.org/2010-05/msg00118.html</a>. The following code prints out a trace of the file</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>POIFSLister lister = new POIFSLister();&#xA;lister.viewFile(spreadsheetPath, true);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you get an output mentioning encryption then you cannot open the file with POI.</p>&#xA;

Thank Tarski :)

<p>See <a href="http://poi.apache.org/encryption.html">http://poi.apache.org/encryption.html</a> - if you're using a recent enough copy of Apache POI (eg 3.8) then encrypted .xls files (HSSF) and .xlsx files (XSSF) can be decrypted (proving you have the password!)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the moment you can't write out encrypted excel files though, only un-encrypted ones</p>&#xA;

<p>Here is a complete example code that reads in a protected excel file, decrypts using a password and writes out unprotected excel file </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    public static void readProtectedBinFile() {&#xA;    try {&#xA;&#xA;        InputStream inp = new FileInputStream("c:\\tmp\\protectedFile.xls");&#xA;        org.apache.poi.hssf.record.crypto.Biff8EncryptionKey.setCurrentUserPassword("abracadabra"); &#xA;&#xA;        Workbook wb;&#xA;        wb = WorkbookFactory.create(inp);&#xA;&#xA;        // Write the output to a file&#xA;        FileOutputStream fileOut;&#xA;        fileOut = new FileOutputStream("c:\\tmp\\unprotectedworkbook.xlsx");&#xA;        wb.write(fileOut);&#xA;        fileOut.close();&#xA;    } catch (InvalidFormatException e) {&#xA;        e.printStackTrace();&#xA;    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {&#xA;        e.printStackTrace();&#xA;    } catch (IOException e) {&#xA;        e.printStackTrace();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
