<p>I'm trying to add the lucene sandbox contribution called <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/lucene-sandbox/index.html#Term%20Highlighter" rel="nofollow">term-highlighter</a> to my pom.xml.&#xA;I'm not really that familiar with Maven, but the code has a <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/highlighter/pom.xml.template" rel="nofollow">pom.xml.template</a> which &#xA;seems to imply if I add a dependency that looks like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;&#xA;  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.lucene&lt;/groupId&gt;&#xA;  &lt;artifactId&gt;lucene-highlighter&lt;/artifactId&gt;&#xA;&lt;/dependency&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It might work. Can someone help me out in adding a lucene-community project to my pom.xml file?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for the comments, it turns out that adding the version was all I needed, and I just guessed it should match the lucene-core version I was using.:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;&#xA;	&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.lucene&lt;/groupId&gt;&#xA;	&lt;artifactId&gt;lucene-highlighter&lt;/artifactId&gt;&#xA;	&lt;version&gt;2.3.1&lt;/version&gt;&#xA;&lt;/dependency&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>You have to add the version number, but you only have to do it once in a project structure. That is, if the version number is defined in a parent pom, you don't have to give the version number again. (But you don't even have to provide the dependency in this case since the dependency will be inherited anyways.)</p>&#xA;
