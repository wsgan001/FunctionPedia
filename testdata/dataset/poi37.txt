QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>I use Apache POI to write excel sheets. I'm very happy with it, but I have the following problem: my program is multi-currency and internationalized. In the excel sheet I write, I want my currency cells to be properly formatted. For that, </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I need a routine that would build the right Excel currency format (eg: "[$$-409]#,##0.00;-[$$-409]#,##0.00") from java.util.Currency and java..util.Locale parameters.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Something like: <code>public String getExcelCurrencyFormat(Currency currency, Locale locale);</code></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is anyone aware of such a library?</p>&#xA;

<p>Couldn't you just flag the field as being a currency field, and let Excel figure out the right format to use? Or does Excel require you to specify the format to produce the relevant 'type'?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would have suggested using java.text.NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() but there appears to be no way to get the actual format used by the instance from the object itself (unless tostring() returns it).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Off the top of my head I can't think of anything else sorry.</p>&#xA;
