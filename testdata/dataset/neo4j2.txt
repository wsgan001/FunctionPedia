oh, I was hoping for something with a C# client library/bindings.  I don't suppose you know of something similar to Neo4j in the C# world?
not sure about similarity to Neo4j, but have a look over here for a list of graph databases: http://graph-database.org/

<p>Just updating this question with a more current option - the Neo4jClient available on NuGet. The package and links to the project site are at <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Neo4jClient">http://nuget.org/packages/Neo4jClient</a></p>&#xA;
