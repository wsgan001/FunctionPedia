QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>I have a ms-word document (MS-Office 2003; non-xml). Within this&#xA;document there is a string associated with a bookmark. Furthermore,&#xA;the word document contains word-macros. My goal is to read the&#xA;document with java, replace the string associated with the bookmark,&#xA;and save the document back to word format.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My first approach was using Apache POI HWPF:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>HWPFDocument doc = new HWPFDocument(new FileInputStream("Test.doc"));&#xA;doc.write(new FileOutputStream("Test_generated.doc"));&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem with this solution is that the generated file does not&#xA;contain the macro anymore (File size of the original document: 32k;&#xA;file size of the generated document 19k).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anybody now if it's possible to retain all the original info&#xA;using POI/HWPF?</p>&#xA;
