<p>Have you tried loading it up as a standard .xls using POI, amending it and then saving it ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the approach I've used for inserting macros in a POI-generated .xls. I create the file with the macro (admittedly as an .xls) and then load it into my app, populate with data and save as a newly-created .xls. That all worked fine.</p>&#xA;

<p>You can directly load an .xls that will act as the template, and modify it. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>POIFSFileSystem fs = new POIFSFileSystem(&#xA;    	        new FileInputStream("template.xls"));&#xA;HSSFWorkbook wb = new  HSSFWorkbook(fs, true);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Will load an xls, preserving its structure (macros included).
