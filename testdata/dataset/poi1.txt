<p>Can anyone tell me how to create doc files using java?&#xA;I know, there's a POI library, but it seems like it can save only simple documents. You can read anything you wish, but you can't save it all back again. Or may be i missed something? How can i save whole document with pictures, tables and styles?</p>&#xA;
