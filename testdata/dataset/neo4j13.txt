<p>I've been looking into setting up and trying out Neo4j on Amazon EC2 however I seem to have hit a road block with finding documentation that I can use.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, this page mentions "Clustering, High Availability and Online Backup are add-on components that manage distribution and consistency over several live or offline node spaces."  However, I haven't been able to find any more information on these add-ons.&#xA;<a href="http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Neo4j_in_the_Cloud" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Neo4j_in_the_Cloud</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seemingly key wiki page describing how to set up Neo4j seems to be missing some very information.&#xA;<a href="http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Neo4j_Setup_HowTo" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Neo4j_Setup_HowTo</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is anyone else using this and referencing better documentation?  Or am I retarded and completely missing something?  Or both?</p>&#xA;

The HA support is currently in beta, we will be able to let you test it as soon as Neo4j 1.0 is out of the door, which is before end of Jan 2010.</p>&#xA;
