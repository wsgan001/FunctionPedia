QUESTION:
HTML:
<p>I've been Googling for quite awhile and haven't found a definitive answer.  Is it possible to output a table using Apache POI?  It looks like it hasn't been implemented, since the main developer stopped working on it like 5 years ago.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there an open source alternative to POI that can do this?</p>&#xA;

<p>I think you're right in that Apache POI is dead in the water. Clearly it wasn't glamourous enough.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only alternative that I'm aware of is <a href="http://itextdocs.lowagie.com/tutorial/rtf/index.php" rel="nofollow">iText</a>, which can generate RTF documents, which MS Word (and every other similar application) can read. It includes full table support.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And, of course, iText can generate PDF also.</p>&#xA;
